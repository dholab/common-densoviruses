Here, we analyzed the coding genome of cHL by microdissecting tumor and normal cells from 34 patient biopsies, for a total of ~50,000 singly isolated lymphoma cells. We uncovered several recurrently mutated genes, namely STAT6 (32% of cases), GNA13 (24%), XPO1 (18%) and ITPKB (16%), and document the functional role of mutant STAT6 in sustaining tumor cell viability. Mutations of STAT6 genetically and functionally cooperated with disruption of SOCS1, a JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor, to promote cHL growth. Overall, 87% of cases showed dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway by genetic alterations in multiple genes (also including STAT3, STAT5B, JAK1, JAK2, PTPN1), attesting to the pivotal role of this pathway in cHL pathogenesis, and highlighting its potential as new therapeutic target in this disease.","25":"The three-dimensional folding of genomes in the eukaryotic nucleus can influence the expression of genes.

Both forms of pol III occupy the same target genes, in very constant proportions within one cell line, suggesting that the two forms of pol III have similar function with regard to specificity for target genes.\rConclusions: POLR3G and POLR3GL occupy the same target genes, but they are differentially expressed under different conditions and in different cell types.\rOverall design: Pol III target genes in human IMR cells, Mouse liver, and Mouse Hepatocarcinoma cells were identified by chromatin Immuno-precipitation followed by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq.

To understand these human interventions, we compared the microbiota present in abiotic surfaces of clinical settings and other built environments. State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings. Our results highlight that the loss of microbial diversity correlates with an increase of resistances and indicate the need of implementing strategies to restore diversity to counteract propagation of resistances in the future.","43":"Sequence reads from CSF specimens collected from patients with encephalitis without identified infectious etiology at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, CO, USA.","44":"We report the application of genome architecture mapping in specific cell types in mouse brain.

Changes in AS patterns have been found to be linked to manifold biological processes, yet fundamental aspects such as the regulation of AS and the functional implications of altered AS programs largely remain to be addressed. In this work, widespread AS regulation by Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues (AtPTBs) was revealed. In total 452 AS events derived from 308 distinct genes were found to be responsive to the levels of the splicing factors AtPTB1 and AtPTB2, which predominantly triggered splicing of regulated introns, inclusion of cassette exons, and usage of upstream 5' splice sites. In contrast, alternative 3' splice site events were strongly underrepresented among the AtPTB1/2 targets and no major AS regulatory function of the distantly related AtPTB3 was found. Dependent on their position within the mRNA, AtPTB-regulated events can both modify the untranslated regions and give rise to alternative protein products. Gene ontology analysis revealed a connection of AtPTB-mediated AS control with diverse biological processes, and the functional implications of selected AS events were further elucidated in the context of seed germination and flowering time control. Specifically, AtPTB misexpression changes AS of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 (PIF6) pre-mRNA, coinciding with altered rates of abscisic acid-dependent seed germination. Furthermore, AS patterns as well as the expression of key flowering regulators were massively changed in an AtPTB1/2 level-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work has revealed widespread AS regulatory functions of the AtPTB splicing factors with important functional implications in various fundamental processes of Arabidopsis development.\rOverall design: Analysis of alternative splicing patterns in plants with increased and decreased levels of the 3 Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein homologues in comparison to wild type samples, determined in duplicates","55":"Illustrating the cellular architecture of the mammalian brain is critical to understanding its diverse functions and complex animal behaviors.

We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons.

However, the pathologic contributors to influenza upper respiratory tissue pathology are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17RA as a modulator of influenza host response and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract.

Recent reports indicate that reconstituting physiologic microbial experience to specific pathogen free (SPF) mice induces durable immunological changes that better recapitulate the human immune system. We examined the impact of microbial experience on responses to vaccination after cohousing laboratory mice with pet store mice. We demonstrate that human transcriptional responses to influenza vaccination are better recapitulated in cohoused mice. Induction of humoral responses by vaccination was dampened in cohoused mice and resulted in poor control upon challenge. Additionally, the establishment of protective heterosubtypic T cell immunity was compromised in cohoused mice. In summary, SPF mice exaggerated both humoral and T cell protection induced by influenza vaccines compared to cohoused mice, suggesting that reconstituting microbial experience in laboratory mice through cohousing may better inform preclinical vaccine testing.\rOverall design: SAMPLE GROUP 1: Pet store mice were purchased from various Twin Cities area pet stores. Pet store mice were cohoused with 8-week-old female C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory). Cohousing occurred within a BSL-3 facility. C57BL/6 mice were cohoused for 60 days, bled for flow cytometry analysis and screened for infectious agents using EZ-spot and PCR Rodent Infections Agent (PRIA) array methods (Charles River Laboratories). Age-matched mice were maintained in SPF facilities.\rSAMPLE GROUP 2: For IAV infections, mice were anesthetized using a weight-based dose of ketamine/xylazine delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Mice were vaccinated intranasally (i.n.) with 1000 PFU of X31 or vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 180 ug of 2019-2020 seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur) with or without 25 uL AddaVax (InvivoGen).

The cDNA library was prepared using strand-specific RNA-sequencing protocols. Samples were run on an Illumina NovaSeq (50 bp paired-end). We obtained an average of 27 million read pairs per sample. Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using Bowtie aligner (bowtie2 version 2.3.4.1) with local mode, -L 22 and -N 1 parameters (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Reads were assigned to Ensembl gene models (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.87.gtf) with featureCounts of the Subread software package (version 1.5.1) (Liao et al., 2014). The reads count matrices were organized corresponding to experimental design and used for subsequent statistical analysis using the bioconductor package edgeR (version 3.24.3) (McCarthy et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2010). The raw reads count table were normalized by using default method in the package prior to generating statistics. Multidimensional scaling was performed with edgeR using the top 500 differentially expressed genes across samples.

Although literature on maternal contribution to hereditary diseases are growing, the paternal contribution is frequently underrecognized. Since human studies reported that 80% of transmitted mutations arise in the paternal germline, it is crucial to understand the mechanism underlying the paternally inherited genome instability. Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of mutagenesis through inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we used sex-separated C. elegans mutants to investigate the paternal contribution to IR-induced transgenerational effects. Specifically, we found that paternal exposure to IR leads to a transgenerational embryonic lethality, and this effect is only observed when the radiation exposure occurred close to the time of fertilization. In the offspring of the irradiated males (F1 generation), we detected various genome instability phenotypes, including DNA fragmentation, chromosomal rearrangement, and aneuploidy. These phenotypes are attributed to the usage of two error-prone repair machinery, the polymerase-theta mediated end joining (TMEJ) and the non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ). Surprisingly, depletion of a human histone H1.0 ortholog, HIS-24, can significantly rescue this transgenerational embryonic lethality. Moreover, this rescue effect is associated with the downregulation of heterochromatin marker histone 3 lysine 9 di-methylation (H3K9me2), and the knocking-down of heterochromatin protein, HPL-1, could mimic the rescue effect of HIS-24 depletion. We also noticed that removal of the histone H1 and heterochromatin marker could activate the error-free repair machinery, Homologous Recombination repair (HR), thus improving the viability of the offspring carrying paternally inherited DNA damage. Altogether, our work sheds light on the importance of paternal radiation exposure on the health of offspring. In addition, our work establishes a previously unknown mechanism underlying the transgenerational genome instability and provides a potential therapeutic target for preventing the hereditary diseases caused by paternal radiation exposure.","70":"We report 2,649 crossover breakpoints identified by single-cell DNA sequencing of 217 sperm in a B6xCAST F1 mouse, which is heterozygous at Prdm9, with one wild-type CAST allele and one allele found in human populations (bred from a genetically engineered mother, Davies et al Nature 2012).

We have an incomplete understanding of how cytokines elicit their functional pleiotropy, which has limited their therapeutic use. Here, using Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we have performed detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human Th-1 cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We have identified CDK8 as a new negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities that contributes to the diversification of IL-6 responses.  We found that CDK8 is a major regulator of the IL-6 phosphoproteome, and interacts with STAT3 in the nucleus upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecules inhibitors, reduced the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. This, in turn, resulted in retention of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus, which increased the binding of STAT3 to target DNA sites in the genome with a concomitant increase in STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions resulted in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity via modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to tuning STAT3 mediated responses.\rOverall design: Role of CDK8 in IL-6-induced STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity in human T cells.","72":"Using single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, we profiled mouse embryonic stem cells and neural precursor cells to identify lincRNAs with cell type- and subpopulation-specific expression. In contrast to mRNAs, we found that lincRNAs are prone to prematurely terminate transcription, are less abundant across single cells, and are degraded by the nuclear exosome. These properties indicate that lincRNA genes widely function without requiring their RNA product. To test this prediction experimentally, we developed a method that separates the role of a lincRNA gene from the role of its RNA product. This revealed RNA-independent lincRNA gene activities, underscoring the importance of distinguishing the roles of transcription, the genomic locus, and the RNA product when studying non-coding loci, for which we are providing suitable tools.\rOverall design: Two mESC lines (BL6xCAST and CASTxBL6) were differentiated into neural precursor cells, as well as being sampled in 2i+LIF and in serum+LIF medium. Bulk RNA-seq was performed for all timepoints (2i+LIF, serum+LIF, day3, day6 and day8 of differentiation). Most timepoints were also sampled by single-cell RNA-seq (96 cells per sample, 7 samples in total). Cell lines with lincRNA genomic deletions, or with the hammerhead ribozyme genomically integrated into lincRNA loci, were also analysed by bulk RNA-seq (140 cell lines in total). We also performed CRosslinking and Analysis of CDNAs (CRAC) in wild-type cells or cells where endogenous Mtr4 is tagged with a FLAG-Bio tag, to examine transcriptome-wide targets of the nuclear RNA surveillance factor Mtr4.

These sequential processes require concerted actions of a large number of proteins during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), but the molecular basis of the required regulation is only partially understood. Here, we have characterized an essential Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) transcription factor (we refer to it as PfAP2-P; Master Regulator of Pathogenesis) that shows two peaks of expression during the IDC at 16- and 40-hour post invasion (h.p.i.). When expression of PfAP2-P at 40 h.p.i. was disrupted using an inducible gene knockout approach, ∆PfAP2-P parasites unable to form mature merozoites and egress from the host RBCs owing to strong down-regulation of several known egress- and invasion-associated genes, in addition to several novel hypothetical genes of thought to be involved in these key life cycle processes during the IDC. Disruption of PfAP2-P  expression at 16 h.p.i. results in transcriptional activation of virtually majority of silenced var genes observed at both bulk and single cell level. This is also reflected by significantly higher level of recognition of the exported proteins on the ∆PfAP2-P parasite-infected RBCs by pooled sera from malaria-exposed individuals from endemic region. In addition, over expression of many early gametocyte marker genes was also observed in ∆PfAP2-P parasites at both 40 h.p.i., and at 16 h.p.i. PfAP2-P directly regulates these genes by binding to their promoter region or indirectly through 14 other down-stream AP2 transcription factors. Taken together, we conclude that PfAP2-P is an upstream transcriptional regulator that participates in mutually exclusive expression pattern shown by the var family of genes and a critical determinant of parasite’s growth during the IDC.\rOverall design: Chip was performed on AP2-P parasites at 40 hour post invasion and 16 hour post invasion using rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9me3 (RRID:AB_310620), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9ac (RRID:AB_310544), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K4me3(RRID:AB_306649) antibodies .

However, a comprehensive genome-wide molecular annotation of the mechanism of gastrulation has yet to be undertaken. Here, we reported the findings of a transcriptome study of cell populations at defined positions in the epiblast, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm of the pre-gastrulation and gastrulation stage embryos. This developmental and spatial transcriptome has defined the genealogy of sub-populations of cells in the germ layers.

State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings.
