Here, we analyzed the coding genome of cHL by microdissecting tumor and normal cells from 34 patient biopsies, for a total of ~50,000 singly isolated lymphoma cells. We uncovered several recurrently mutated genes, namely STAT6 (32% of cases), GNA13 (24%), XPO1 (18%) and ITPKB (16%), and document the functional role of mutant STAT6 in sustaining tumor cell viability. Mutations of STAT6 genetically and functionally cooperated with disruption of SOCS1, a JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor, to promote cHL growth. Overall, 87% of cases showed dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway by genetic alterations in multiple genes (also including STAT3, STAT5B, JAK1, JAK2, PTPN1), attesting to the pivotal role of this pathway in cHL pathogenesis, and highlighting its potential as new therapeutic target in this disease.","2":"The three-dimensional folding of genomes in the eukaryotic nucleus can influence the expression of genes.

Both forms of pol III occupy the same target genes, in very constant proportions within one cell line, suggesting that the two forms of pol III have similar function with regard to specificity for target genes.\rConclusions: POLR3G and POLR3GL occupy the same target genes, but they are differentially expressed under different conditions and in different cell types.\rOverall design: Pol III target genes in human IMR cells, Mouse liver, and Mouse Hepatocarcinoma cells were identified by chromatin Immuno-precipitation followed by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq. For Human IMR90 cells, we used antibodies against POLR3D, POLR3G, POLR3GL and BDP1. For Mouse data, we targeted POLR3D, POLR3G and POLR3GL and did ChIP_seq replicates.

Here, we analyzed the coding genome of cHL by microdissecting tumor and normal cells from 34 patient biopsies, for a total of ~50,000 singly isolated lymphoma cells. We uncovered several recurrently mutated genes, namely STAT6 (32% of cases), GNA13 (24%), XPO1 (18%) and ITPKB (16%), and document the functional role of mutant STAT6 in sustaining tumor cell viability. Mutations of STAT6 genetically and functionally cooperated with disruption of SOCS1, a JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor, to promote cHL growth. Overall, 87% of cases showed dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway by genetic alterations in multiple genes (also including STAT3, STAT5B, JAK1, JAK2, PTPN1), attesting to the pivotal role of this pathway in cHL pathogenesis, and highlighting its potential as new therapeutic target in this disease.","41":"The composition of circuating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing data was analyzed in terms of repeat families in order to obtain insights on potential mechanisms behind the active release of CNA into the blood stream.","42":"Probiotics have been suggested as a nutritional supplement to prevent gut microbiome (GM) imbalances. However, the probiotics marketed today colonize the gut to a limited extent and thus have limited influence on the overall GM composition. The gut viral community is predominated by bacteriophages that attack bacteria in a host-specific manner. Fecal virome transplantation (FVT) have been shown to alter GM composition in the recipients. Here we investigate the use of FVT as a mean to alter GM composition to a degree, that could lead the way for persistent colonization of two types of probiotics. Namely Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) representing a well-established probiotic and Akkermansia muciniphila (AKM) representing a next-generation probiotic. Male and female C57BL/6NTac mice were cohoused in pairs at 4 weeks of age and grouped as: AKM+FVT, probiotic sham (Pro-sham)+FVT, LGG+Saline, AKM+Saline, and Pro-sham+Saline (control group). The FVT originated from donor mice with high relative abundance of A. muciniphila. The different treatments were performed twice, and all animals were terminated at age 9 weeks. The FVT treatment did not increase the abundance of the administered LGG or AKM. Instead FVT significantly (p < 0.05) increased the abundance of natural occurring A. muciniphila compared to the control group. This raise the potential of stimulating the commensal “probiotics” that already are permanent members of the gut. Unexpectedly, the FVT treated mice were observed with a significant (p < 0.05) increase in fertility rate that was independent of probiotic administration (LGG or AKM). These preliminary observations urge for supporting studies.","43":"Diverse microbial communities inhabit human-occupied buildings and circulate in indoor air; however, little is known about viral diversity in these environments.

This study significantly expands the known airborne viral diversity found indoors, enabling the design of sensitive and quantitative assays to further investigate specific viruses of interest.","44":"Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health, but less is known how microbial control in health care or cleanroom facilities modifies the in-house microbiota and its associated resistome. To understand these human interventions, we compared the microbiota present in abiotic surfaces of clinical settings and other built environments. State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings. Our results highlight that the loss of microbial diversity correlates with an increase of resistances and indicate the need of implementing strategies to restore diversity to counteract propagation of resistances in the future.","45":"Sequence reads from CSF specimens collected from patients with encephalitis without identified infectious etiology at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, CO, USA.","46":"After the identification of a direct interaction between TOPVIBL and REC114, we characterized the phenotype of the mutant mouse.

In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer.

Changes in AS patterns have been found to be linked to manifold biological processes, yet fundamental aspects such as the regulation of AS and the functional implications of altered AS programs largely remain to be addressed. In this work, widespread AS regulation by Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues (AtPTBs) was revealed. In total 452 AS events derived from 308 distinct genes were found to be responsive to the levels of the splicing factors AtPTB1 and AtPTB2, which predominantly triggered splicing of regulated introns, inclusion of cassette exons, and usage of upstream 5' splice sites. In contrast, alternative 3' splice site events were strongly underrepresented among the AtPTB1/2 targets and no major AS regulatory function of the distantly related AtPTB3 was found. Dependent on their position within the mRNA, AtPTB-regulated events can both modify the untranslated regions and give rise to alternative protein products. Gene ontology analysis revealed a connection of AtPTB-mediated AS control with diverse biological processes, and the functional implications of selected AS events were further elucidated in the context of seed germination and flowering time control. Specifically, AtPTB misexpression changes AS of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 (PIF6) pre-mRNA, coinciding with altered rates of abscisic acid-dependent seed germination. Furthermore, AS patterns as well as the expression of key flowering regulators were massively changed in an AtPTB1/2 level-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work has revealed widespread AS regulatory functions of the AtPTB splicing factors with important functional implications in various fundamental processes of Arabidopsis development.\rOverall design: Analysis of alternative splicing patterns in plants with increased and decreased levels of the 3 Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein homologues in comparison to wild type samples, determined in duplicates","55":"Perform viral metagenomic sequencing on hospital wastewater to explore the diversity of viruses in hospital sewage.","56":"The three-dimensional folding of genomes in the eukaryotic nucleus can influence the expression of genes.

However, the pathologic contributors to influenza upper respiratory tissue pathology are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17RA as a modulator of influenza host response and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. We used a combined experimental approach involving IL-17RA-/- mice and an air-liquid interface (ALI) epithelial culture model to investigate the role of IL-17 response in epithelial inflammation, barrier function, and tissue pathology.

Recent reports indicate that reconstituting physiologic microbial experience to specific pathogen free (SPF) mice induces durable immunological changes that better recapitulate the human immune system. We examined the impact of microbial experience on responses to vaccination after cohousing laboratory mice with pet store mice. We demonstrate that human transcriptional responses to influenza vaccination are better recapitulated in cohoused mice. Induction of humoral responses by vaccination was dampened in cohoused mice and resulted in poor control upon challenge. Additionally, the establishment of protective heterosubtypic T cell immunity was compromised in cohoused mice. In summary, SPF mice exaggerated both humoral and T cell protection induced by influenza vaccines compared to cohoused mice, suggesting that reconstituting microbial experience in laboratory mice through cohousing may better inform preclinical vaccine testing.\rOverall design: SAMPLE GROUP 1: Pet store mice were purchased from various Twin Cities area pet stores. Pet store mice were cohoused with 8-week-old female C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory). Cohousing occurred within a BSL-3 facility.

We and others previously showed that paternal administration of dexamethasone in mice affects the phenotype of their offspring. The substrate of intergenerational transmission of environmentally induced effects often involves changes in sperm RNA, yet other epigenetic modifications in the germline can be affected and are also plausible candidates. First, we tested the involvement of altered sperm RNAs in the transmission of dexamethasone induced phenotypes across generations. We did this by injecting sperm RNA into naïve fertilized oocytes, before performing metabolic and behavioral phenotyping of the offspring. We observed phenotypic changes in discordance with those found in offspring generated by in vitro fertilization using sperm from dexamethasone exposed males. Second, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on chromatin accessibility using ATAC sequencing and found significant changes at specific genomic features and gene regulatory loci. Employing q-RT-PCR, we show altered expression of a gene in the tissue of offspring affected by accessibility changes in sperm.

However, whether these marks can be passed on from gametes to the next generation in mammals is a long-standing question that remains unclear. By developing a highly sensitive approach, STAR ChIP-seq, we provided a panoramic view of the landscape of H3K4me3, a histone hallmark for transcription initiation 2, from developing gametes to postimplantation embryos. Interestingly, we found that upon fertilization, extensive reprogramming occurred on the paternal genome, as few H3K4me3 peaks were observed in zygotes before they reappeared after major zygotic genome activation at the late 2-cell stage. On the maternal genome, we unexpectedly found a non-canonical form of H3K4me3 (ncH3K4me3) in full-grown and mature oocytes, which exists as broad peaks at promoters and a large number of distal loci. Such broad H3K4me3 peaks are in striking contrast to typical sharp H3K4me3 peaks restricted in CpG rich regions of promoters. Interestingly, ncH3K4me3 in oocytes overlaps almost exclusively with partially methylated DNA domains (PMDs). It is then inherited in preimplantation embryos before being erased in the late 2-cell embryos, when canonical H3K4me3 starts to be established. The removal of ncH3K4me3 requires zygotic transcription but is independent of DNA replication mediated passive dilution. Finally, downregulation of H3K4me3 in full-grown oocytes by overexpressing an H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5B is associated with defects in genome silencing. Taken together, these data unveiled inheritance and highly dynamic reprogramming of the epigenome in early mammalian development.\rOverall design: Mouse preimplantation embryos were obtained from crosses of C57BL/6N and PWK.

We have an incomplete understanding of how cytokines elicit their functional pleiotropy, which has limited their therapeutic use. Here, using Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we have performed detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human Th-1 cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We have identified CDK8 as a new negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities that contributes to the diversification of IL-6 responses.  We found that CDK8 is a major regulator of the IL-6 phosphoproteome, and interacts with STAT3 in the nucleus upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecules inhibitors, reduced the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. This, in turn, resulted in retention of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus, which increased the binding of STAT3 to target DNA sites in the genome with a concomitant increase in STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions resulted in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity via modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to tuning STAT3 mediated responses.\rOverall design: Role of CDK8 in IL-6-induced STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity in human T cells.","75":"Using single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, we profiled mouse embryonic stem cells and neural precursor cells to identify lincRNAs with cell type- and subpopulation-specific expression. In contrast to mRNAs, we found that lincRNAs are prone to prematurely terminate transcription, are less abundant across single cells, and are degraded by the nuclear exosome. These properties indicate that lincRNA genes widely function without requiring their RNA product. To test this prediction experimentally, we developed a method that separates the role of a lincRNA gene from the role of its RNA product. This revealed RNA-independent lincRNA gene activities, underscoring the importance of distinguishing the roles of transcription, the genomic locus, and the RNA product when studying non-coding loci, for which we are providing suitable tools.\rOverall design: Two mESC lines (BL6xCAST and CASTxBL6) were differentiated into neural precursor cells, as well as being sampled in 2i+LIF and in serum+LIF medium.

Most timepoints were also sampled by single-cell RNA-seq (96 cells per sample, 7 samples in total). Cell lines with lincRNA genomic deletions, or with the hammerhead ribozyme genomically integrated into lincRNA loci, were also analysed by bulk RNA-seq (140 cell lines in total). We also performed CRosslinking and Analysis of CDNAs (CRAC) in wild-type cells or cells where endogenous Mtr4 is tagged with a FLAG-Bio tag, to examine transcriptome-wide targets of the nuclear RNA surveillance factor Mtr4.

These sequential processes require concerted actions of a large number of proteins during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), but the molecular basis of the required regulation is only partially understood. Here, we have characterized an essential Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) transcription factor (we refer to it as PfAP2-P; Master Regulator of Pathogenesis) that shows two peaks of expression during the IDC at 16- and 40-hour post invasion (h.p.i.). When expression of PfAP2-P at 40 h.p.i. was disrupted using an inducible gene knockout approach, ∆PfAP2-P parasites unable to form mature merozoites and egress from the host RBCs owing to strong down-regulation of several known egress- and invasion-associated genes, in addition to several novel hypothetical genes of thought to be involved in these key life cycle processes during the IDC. Disruption of PfAP2-P  expression at 16 h.p.i. results in transcriptional activation of virtually majority of silenced var genes observed at both bulk and single cell level. This is also reflected by significantly higher level of recognition of the exported proteins on the ∆PfAP2-P parasite-infected RBCs by pooled sera from malaria-exposed individuals from endemic region. In addition, over expression of many early gametocyte marker genes was also observed in ∆PfAP2-P parasites at both 40 h.p.i., and at 16 h.p.i. PfAP2-P directly regulates these genes by binding to their promoter region or indirectly through 14 other down-stream AP2 transcription factors. Taken together, we conclude that PfAP2-P is an upstream transcriptional regulator that participates in mutually exclusive expression pattern shown by the var family of genes and a critical determinant of parasite’s growth during the IDC.\rOverall design: Chip was performed on AP2-P parasites at 40 hour post invasion and 16 hour post invasion using rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9me3 (RRID:AB_310620), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9ac (RRID:AB_310544), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K4me3(RRID:AB_306649) antibodies . There are two biological replicates for each developmental stages. The input  served as the control.","78":"The three-dimensional folding of genomes in the eukaryotic nucleus can influence the expression of genes. We used a new method to determine interactions between different chromatin regions genome-wide. Using a simple statistical model, we determine the subset of those interactions which represent stable contacts. We find an enrichment in contacts between active genes, between Polycomb-repressed genes, between enhancer elements and between enhancers and active genes.\rOverall design: We used a new method to detect interactions from 490 46C Mouse ES cell derived samples","79":"Nucleic acids in wastewater provide a rich source of data for detection and surveillance of microbes. We have longitudinally collected 116 RNA samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Berlin/Germany, from March 2021 to July 2022, and 24 DNA samples from May to July 2022. We tracked human astroviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses and adenoviruses over time to the level of strains or even individual nucleotide variations, showing how detailed human pathogens can be observed using wastewater. For respiratory pathogens, a broad enrichment panel enabled us to detect waves of RSV, influenza, or common cold coronaviruses in high agreement with clinical data. By applying a profile Hidden Markov Model-based search for novel viruses, we identified more than 100 thousand novel transcript assemblies likely not belonging to known virus species, thus substantially expanding our knowledge of virus diversity. Phylogenetic analysis is shown for bunyaviruses and parvoviruses. Finally, we identify Hundreds of novel protein sequences for CRISPR-associated proteins such as Transposase B, a class of small RNA-guided DNA editing enzymes. Taken together, we present a longitudinal and deep investigation into wastewater-derived genomic sequencing data that underlines the value of sewage surveillance for public health, planetary virome research, and biotechnological potential.\rOverall design: Raw influx from Berlin/Germany wastewater treatment plants was collected over a time period from May 2021 to July 2022, total RNA and (from May 2022 to July 2022) total DNA extracted and subjected to high-throughput sequencing.","8":"Illustrating the cellular architecture of the mammalian brain is critical to understanding its diverse functions and complex animal behaviors. With support from NIMH and NINDS as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), the Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA) applied single nucleus methylation sequencing in 118 brain funtional regions across the whole adult male P56 C57BL/6J mouse brain. In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons. These data define the landscape of cell type and spatial heterogeneity in the mouse brain and the underlining regulatory epigenomic basis.\rOverall design: Apply snmC-seq2 to 118 brain functional regions to identify epigenomic landcape of the adult mouse brain, this subseries consists of one single nucleus methylation sequencing experiment of brain region (ACA,PL,ILA).","80":"Deep sequencing environmental air samples.","81":"The effect of crop rotation between wetland rice and upland maize on the microbial colonization of the roots","82":"The three-dimensional folding of genomes in the eukaryotic nucleus can influence the expression of genes.

The single iHEC can be robustly educated into induced haematopoietic progenitor cells (iHPC), which gave rise to induced T cells (iT cells) with abundant TCRαβ repertoire in vivo. We  sorted  the  single iHEC and iHPC  from  day-14,  day-17,  day-21  cell  products  derived  from  241 iR9-ES  and  performed  single-cell  RNA-Seq.\rOverall design: mRNA profiles of 73 single
