ERR2699812	0.907	PRJEB27640	SAMEA4790996	Comparative metagenomics of controlled and uncontrolled built environments.	Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health, but less is known how microbial control in health care or cleanroom facilities modifies the in-house microbiota and its associated resistome. To understand these human interventions, we compared the microbiota present in abiotic surfaces of clinical settings and other built environments. State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings. Our results highlight that the loss of microbial diversity correlates with an increase of resistances and indicate the need of implementing strategies to restore diversity to counteract propagation of resistances in the future.

With support from NIMH and NINDS as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), the Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA) applied single nucleus methylation sequencing in 117 brain funtional regions across the whole adult male P56 C57BL/6J mouse brain. In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons. These data define the landscape of cell type and spatial heterogeneity in the mouse brain and the underlining regulatory epigenomic basis.Overall design: Apply snmC-seq2 to 117 brain functional regions to identify epigenomic landcape of the adult mouse brain, this subseries consists of one single nucleus methylation sequencing experiment of brain region (12J_210225, 12J_210304, 13A_190725, 13A_200102, 13B_201203, 13B_201210)."

The host response in the NP regulates an intricate balance between viral control and tissue pathology. The hyper-inflammatory responses promote epithelial injury, allowing for increased viral dissemination and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. However, the pathologic contributors to influenza upper respiratory tissue pathology are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17RA as a modulator of influenza host response and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. We used a combined experimental approach involving IL-17RA-/- mice and an air-liquid interface (ALI) epithelial culture model to investigate the role of IL-17 response in epithelial inflammation, barrier function, and tissue pathology. Our data show that IL-17RA-/- mice exhibited significantly reduced neutrophilia, epithelial injury, and viral load. The reduced NP inflammation and epithelial injury in IL-17RA-/- mice correlated with increased resistance against co-infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn).

With support from NIMH and NINDS as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), the Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA) applied single nucleus methylation sequencing in 118 brain funtional regions across the whole adult male P56 C57BL/6J mouse brain. In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons. These data define the landscape of cell type and spatial heterogeneity in the mouse brain and the underlining regulatory epigenomic basis.Overall design: Apply snmC-seq2 to 118 brain functional regions to identify epigenomic landcape of the adult mouse brain, this subseries consists of one single nucleus methylation sequencing experiment of brain region (AON)."

SRR584137	0.816	PRJNA176941	SAMN01760507	Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues from Arabidopsis are key regulators of alternative splicing with implications in fundamental developmental processes	"Alternative splicing (AS) generates transcript variants by the definition of different exonic and intronic regions and causes a massive expansion of transcriptome diversity. Changes in AS patterns have been found to be linked to manifold biological processes, yet fundamental aspects such as the regulation of AS and the functional implications of altered AS programs largely remain to be addressed. In this work, widespread AS regulation by Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues (AtPTBs) was revealed. In total 452 AS events derived from 308 distinct genes were found to be responsive to the levels of the splicing factors AtPTB1 and AtPTB2, which predominantly triggered splicing of regulated introns, inclusion of cassette exons, and usage of upstream 5' splice sites. In contrast, alternative 3' splice site events were strongly underrepresented among the AtPTB1/2 targets and no major AS regulatory function of the distantly related AtPTB3 was found. Dependent on their position within the mRNA, AtPTB-regulated events can both modify the untranslated regions and give rise to alternative protein products. Gene ontology analysis revealed a connection of AtPTB-mediated AS control with diverse biological processes, and the functional implications of selected AS events were further elucidated in the context of seed germination and flowering time control. Specifically, AtPTB misexpression changes AS of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 (PIF6) pre-mRNA, coinciding with altered rates of abscisic acid-dependent seed germination. Furthermore, AS patterns as well as the expression of key flowering regulators were massively changed in an AtPTB1/2 level-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work has revealed widespread AS regulatory functions of the AtPTB splicing factors with important functional implications in various fundamental processes of Arabidopsis development.Overall design: Analysis of alternative splicing patterns in plants with increased and decreased levels of the 3 Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein homologues in comparison to wild type samples, determined in duplicates"	PubMed:23192226	SRS367559	RNA-Seq	GEO	SRX193202	GSM1017178	Arabidopsis thaliana													325.0	401269.0	11199.0	44519118.0	36	7089655	2664	287489926	Illumina Genome Analyzer II	SINGLE	cDNA	TRANSCRIPTOMIC		ILLUMINA	SRP016026	2012-10-23	3282	101	5331			0

We and others previously showed that paternal administration of dexamethasone in mice affects the phenotype of their offspring. The substrate of intergenerational transmission of environmentally induced effects often involves changes in sperm RNA, yet other epigenetic modifications in the germline can be affected and are also plausible candidates. First, we tested the involvement of altered sperm RNAs in the transmission of dexamethasone induced phenotypes across generations. We did this by injecting sperm RNA into naïve fertilized oocytes, before performing metabolic and behavioral phenotyping of the offspring. We observed phenotypic changes in discordance with those found in offspring generated by in vitro fertilization using sperm from dexamethasone exposed males. Second, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on chromatin accessibility using ATAC sequencing and found significant changes at specific genomic features and gene regulatory loci. Employing q-RT-PCR, we show altered expression of a gene in the tissue of offspring affected by accessibility changes in sperm. Third, we establish a correlation between specific DNA modifications and stress hormone receptor activity as a likely contributing factor influencing sperm accessibility. Finally, we independently investigated this dependency by genetically reducing thymine-DNA glycosylase levels and observing concomitant changes at the level of chromatin accessibility and stress hormone receptor activity.Overall design: Tn5 fragmented mouse sperm chromatin of 3 Tdg+/- and 2 Ctrls as well as 3 Dexamethasone injected mice and 2 Vehicles were analyzed in regard to their chromatin accessibility"	PubMed:38065942	SRS17870320	ATAC-seq	EPIGENETICS AND NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY, INS, ETH ZURICH	SRX20565799	GSM7438685	Mus musculus													109.0	24544269.0	2995.0	1684411233.0	46	120664809	1056	5817219902	Illumina NovaSeq 6000	PAIRED	other	GENOMIC	GSM7438685	ILLUMINA	SRP440669	2023-12-09	11239	300	33382			0				
SRR15624099	0.806	PRJNA758072	SAMN20995854	Dirty mice as an alternative for preclinical vaccine testing	"Laboratory mice comprise an inexpensive and expeditious model organism for preclinical vaccine testing; however, vaccine immunogenicity often fails to adequately translate to humans. Recent reports indicate that reconstituting physiologic microbial experience to specific pathogen free (SPF) mice induces durable immunological changes that better recapitulate the human immune system. We examined the impact of microbial experience on responses to vaccination after cohousing laboratory mice with pet store mice. We demonstrate that human transcriptional responses to influenza vaccination are better recapitulated in cohoused mice. Induction of humoral responses by vaccination was dampened in cohoused mice and resulted in poor control upon challenge. Additionally, the establishment of protective heterosubtypic T cell immunity was compromised in cohoused mice. In summary, SPF mice exaggerated both humoral and T cell protection induced by influenza vaccines compared to cohoused mice, suggesting that reconstituting microbial experience in laboratory mice through cohousing may better inform preclinical vaccine testing.Overall design: SAMPLE GROUP 1: Pet store mice were purchased from various Twin Cities area pet stores. Pet store mice were cohoused with 8-week-old female C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory). Cohousing occurred within a BSL-3 facility. C57BL/6 mice were cohoused for 60 days, bled for flow cytometry analysis and screened for infectious agents using EZ-spot and PCR Rodent Infections Agent (PRIA) array methods (Charles River Laboratories). Age-matched mice were maintained in SPF facilities.SAMPLE GROUP 2: For IAV infections, mice were anesthetized using a weight-based dose of ketamine/xylazine delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Mice were vaccinated intranasally (i.n.) with 1000 PFU of X31 or vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 180 ug of 2019-2020 seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur) with or without 25 uL AddaVax (InvivoGen). For challenge, mice were infected i.n. with 1000 PFU of PR8.Whole lungs were harvested and RNA was extracted using AllPrep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen). The cDNA library was prepared using strand-specific RNA-sequencing protocols. Samples were run on an Illumina NovaSeq (50 bp paired-end). We obtained an average of 27 million read pairs per sample. Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using Bowtie aligner (bowtie2 version 2.3.4.1) with local mode, -L 22 and -N 1 parameters (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Reads were assigned to Ensembl gene models (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.87.gtf) with featureCounts of the Subread software package (version 1.5.1) (Liao et al., 2014). The reads count matrices were organized corresponding to experimental design and used for subsequent statistical analysis using the bioconductor package edgeR (version 3.24.3) (McCarthy et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2010). The raw reads count table were normalized by using default method in the package prior to generating statistics. Multidimensional scaling was performed with edgeR using the top 500 differentially expressed genes across samples. The regression model in the edgeR package with block design and interaction model was used for statistical analysis to select the corresponding significant genes. Gene ontology analysis was performed using Panther on genes in each cluster with an adjusted p value <0.01 and LogFC >0.5.Mouse PBMCs were isolated using Ficol-Paque PREMIUM (Millipore Sigma) and RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Plus Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA library was prepared using strand-specific RNA-sequencing protocols. Samples were run on an Illumina NovaSeq (150 bp paired-end). We obtained an average of 35 million read pairs per sample. Sequence processing and mapping was performed as described above. The normalized reads table of mouse blood samples were reformatted to meet the requirements for the subsequent GSEA analysis (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005). The gene lists were prepared from human vaccination data and merged into an immune geneset (c7.immune.datasets.gmt) to generate a customized geneset (c7.custom.immune.datasets.gmt) (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005). The mouse datasets originated from either SPF or dirty mouse models were computed against the customized geneset by using desktop GSEA analysis engine with default parameters except the enrichment plot generation."

We generated cell-type specific chromatin contact maps in mouse dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA DN), pyramidal glutamatergic neurons from the cornus ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus (CA1 PGN), and non-neuronal post-mitotic oligodendrocytes from the somatosensory cortex (SSC_Olig). We explored cell-type specific chromatin topologies genome-wide at multiple genomic scales. Our data demonstrates that chromatin organization is cell type specific and reflects cell specialization at all genomic scales.Overall design: Briefly, we isolated single thin tissue sections by ultrathin cryosectioning (approx. 220 nm) of the mouse brain region of interest, and selected specific cell-types using immunofluorescence with specific AB markers. Following cell identification, 3 nuclear sections (nuclear profiles; NPs) were captured by laser microdissection in individual PCR caps.

The host response in the NP regulates an intricate balance between viral control and tissue pathology. The hyper-inflammatory responses promote epithelial injury, allowing for increased viral dissemination and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. However, the pathologic contributors to influenza upper respiratory tissue pathology are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17RA as a modulator of influenza host response and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. We used a combined experimental approach involving IL-17RA-/- mice and an air-liquid interface (ALI) epithelial culture model to investigate the role of IL-17 response in epithelial inflammation, barrier function, and tissue pathology. Our data show that IL-17RA-/- mice exhibited significantly reduced neutrophilia, epithelial injury, and viral load. The reduced NP inflammation and epithelial injury in IL-17RA-/- mice correlated with increased resistance against co-infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). IL-17A treatment, while potentiating the apoptosis of IAV-infected epithelial cells, caused bystander cell death and disrupted the barrier function in ALI epithelial model, supporting the in vivo findings.Overall design: 13 samples"		SRS16951029	RNA-Seq	UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA	SRX19567618	GSM7081475	Mus musculus													155.0	5096531.0	2464.0	375440833.0	44	34262013	790	1549018966	Illumina HiSeq 4000	PAIRED	cDNA	TRANSCRIPTOMIC	GSM7081475	ILLUMINA	SRP425795	2023-10-31	3164	302	8736			0

We have an incomplete understanding of how cytokines elicit their functional pleiotropy, which has limited their therapeutic use. Here, using Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we have performed detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human Th-1 cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We have identified CDK8 as a new negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities that contributes to the diversification of IL-6 responses.  We found that CDK8 is a major regulator of the IL-6 phosphoproteome, and interacts with STAT3 in the nucleus upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecules inhibitors, reduced the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. This, in turn, resulted in retention of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus, which increased the binding of STAT3 to target DNA sites in the genome with a concomitant increase in STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions resulted in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity via modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to tuning STAT3 mediated responses.Overall design: Role of CDK8 in IL-6-induced STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity in human T cells."

These sequential processes require concerted actions of a large number of proteins during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), but the molecular basis of the required regulation is only partially understood. Here, we have characterized an essential Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) transcription factor (we refer to it as PfAP2-P; Master Regulator of Pathogenesis) that shows two peaks of expression during the IDC at 16- and 40-hour post invasion (h.p.i.). When expression of PfAP2-P at 40 h.p.i. was disrupted using an inducible gene knockout approach, ∆PfAP2-P parasites unable to form mature merozoites and egress from the host RBCs owing to strong down-regulation of several known egress- and invasion-associated genes, in addition to several novel hypothetical genes of thought to be involved in these key life cycle processes during the IDC. Disruption of PfAP2-P  expression at 16 h.p.i. results in transcriptional activation of virtually majority of silenced var genes observed at both bulk and single cell level. This is also reflected by significantly higher level of recognition of the exported proteins on the ∆PfAP2-P parasite-infected RBCs by pooled sera from malaria-exposed individuals from endemic region. In addition, over expression of many early gametocyte marker genes was also observed in ∆PfAP2-P parasites at both 40 h.p.i., and at 16 h.p.i. PfAP2-P directly regulates these genes by binding to their promoter region or indirectly through 14 other down-stream AP2 transcription factors. Taken together, we conclude that PfAP2-P is an upstream transcriptional regulator that participates in mutually exclusive expression pattern shown by the var family of genes and a critical determinant of parasite’s growth during the IDC.Overall design: Chip was performed on AP2-P parasites at 40 hour post invasion and 16 hour post invasion using rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9me3 (RRID:AB_310620), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9ac (RRID:AB_310544), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K4me3(RRID:AB_306649) antibodies .

With support from NIMH and NINDS as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), the Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA) applied single nucleus methylation sequencing in 118 brain funtional regions across the whole adult male P56 C57BL/6J mouse brain. In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons. These data define the landscape of cell type and spatial heterogeneity in the mouse brain and the underlining regulatory epigenomic basis.Overall design: Apply snmC-seq2 to 118 brain functional regions to identify epigenomic landcape of the adult mouse brain, this subseries consists of one single nucleus methylation sequencing experiment of brain region (ACA,PL,ILA)."

In contrast to mRNAs, we found that lincRNAs are prone to prematurely terminate transcription, are less abundant across single cells, and are degraded by the nuclear exosome. These properties indicate that lincRNA genes widely function without requiring their RNA product. To test this prediction experimentally, we developed a method that separates the role of a lincRNA gene from the role of its RNA product. This revealed RNA-independent lincRNA gene activities, underscoring the importance of distinguishing the roles of transcription, the genomic locus, and the RNA product when studying non-coding loci, for which we are providing suitable tools.Overall design: Two mESC lines (BL6xCAST and CASTxBL6) were differentiated into neural precursor cells, as well as being sampled in 2i+LIF and in serum+LIF medium. Bulk RNA-seq was performed for all timepoints (2i+LIF, serum+LIF, day3, day6 and day8 of differentiation). Most timepoints were also sampled by single-cell RNA-seq (96 cells per sample, 7 samples in total). Cell lines with lincRNA genomic deletions, or with the hammerhead ribozyme genomically integrated into lincRNA loci, were also analysed by bulk RNA-seq (140 cell lines in total). We also performed CRosslinking and Analysis of CDNAs (CRAC) in wild-type cells or cells where endogenous Mtr4 is tagged with a FLAG-Bio tag, to examine transcriptome-wide targets of the nuclear RNA surveillance factor Mtr4. For normalisation, we performed NET-seq. To measure global RNA half-lives, we treated wild-type mESCs with actinomycin D, and performed bulk RNA-seq at several timepoints, in triplicate (3 wells of cells were analysed in parallel per timepoint)."

SRR4014433	0.579	PRJNA292073	SAMN03979631	Allelic reprogramming of the histone modification H3K4me3 in early mammalian development	"Histone modifications are considered as fundamental epigenetic regulators that control many crucial cellular processes 1. However, whether these marks can be passed on from gametes to the next generation in mammals is a long-standing question that remains unclear. By developing a highly sensitive approach, STAR ChIP-seq, we provided a panoramic view of the landscape of H3K4me3, a histone hallmark for transcription initiation 2, from developing gametes to postimplantation embryos. Interestingly, we found that upon fertilization, extensive reprogramming occurred on the paternal genome, as few H3K4me3 peaks were observed in zygotes before they reappeared after major zygotic genome activation at the late 2-cell stage. On the maternal genome, we unexpectedly found a non-canonical form of H3K4me3 (ncH3K4me3) in full-grown and mature oocytes, which exists as broad peaks at promoters and a large number of distal loci. Such broad H3K4me3 peaks are in striking contrast to typical sharp H3K4me3 peaks restricted in CpG rich regions of promoters. Interestingly, ncH3K4me3 in oocytes overlaps almost exclusively with partially methylated DNA domains (PMDs). It is then inherited in preimplantation embryos before being erased in the late 2-cell embryos, when canonical H3K4me3 starts to be established. The removal of ncH3K4me3 requires zygotic transcription but is independent of DNA replication mediated passive dilution. Finally, downregulation of H3K4me3 in full-grown oocytes by overexpressing an H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5B is associated with defects in genome silencing. Taken together, these data unveiled inheritance and highly dynamic reprogramming of the epigenome in early mammalian development.Overall design: Mouse preimplantation embryos were obtained from crosses of C57BL/6N and PWK. A newly developed ChIP-seq approach (STAR ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq were performed in these embryos at variou stages in preimplantation development.Please note that [1] 'PN5 zygote histone H3' sample represents input files for PN5_K4me3 sample, using H3 antibody.[2] both separate (for each replicate sample, i.e. sample supplementary file) and combined processed bed file (for all replicates, i.e. Series supplementary file) have been provided."

ERR9613094	0.529	PRJEB52388	SAMEA14104442	Fecal virome transfer improves proliferation of commensal gut Akkermansia muciniphila and unexpectedly enhanced the fertility rate in laboratory mice	Probiotics have been suggested as a nutritional supplement to prevent gut microbiome (GM) imbalances. However, the probiotics marketed today colonize the gut to a limited extent and thus have limited influence on the overall GM composition. The gut viral community is predominated by bacteriophages that attack bacteria in a host-specific manner. Fecal virome transplantation (FVT) have been shown to alter GM composition in the recipients. Here we investigate the use of FVT as a mean to alter GM composition to a degree, that could lead the way for persistent colonization of two types of probiotics. Namely Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) representing a well-established probiotic and Akkermansia muciniphila (AKM) representing a next-generation probiotic. Male and female C57BL/6NTac mice were cohoused in pairs at 4 weeks of age and grouped as: AKM+FVT, probiotic sham (Pro-sham)+FVT, LGG+Saline, AKM+Saline, and Pro-sham+Saline (control group). The FVT originated from donor mice with high relative abundance of A. muciniphila. The different treatments were performed twice, and all animals were terminated at age 9 weeks. The FVT treatment did not increase the abundance of the administered LGG or AKM. Instead FVT significantly (p < 0.05) increased the abundance of natural occurring A. muciniphila compared to the control group. This raise the potential of stimulating the commensal “probiotics” that already are permanent members of the gut. Unexpectedly, the FVT treated mice were observed with a significant (p < 0.05) increase in fertility rate that was independent of probiotic administration (LGG or AKM). These preliminary observations urge for supporting studies.

With support from NIMH and NINDS as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), the Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA) applied single nucleus methylation sequencing in 118 brain funtional regions across the whole adult male P56 C57BL/6J mouse brain. In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons. These data define the landscape of cell type and spatial heterogeneity in the mouse brain and the underlining regulatory epigenomic basis.Overall design: Apply snmC-seq2 to 118 brain functional regions to identify epigenomic landcape of the adult mouse brain, this subseries consists of one single nucleus methylation sequencing experiment of brain region (CP)."

We tracked human astroviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses and adenoviruses over time to the level of strains or even individual nucleotide variations, showing how detailed human pathogens can be observed using wastewater. For respiratory pathogens, a broad enrichment panel enabled us to detect waves of RSV, influenza, or common cold coronaviruses in high agreement with clinical data. By applying a profile Hidden Markov Model-based search for novel viruses, we identified more than 100 thousand novel transcript assemblies likely not belonging to known virus species, thus substantially expanding our knowledge of virus diversity. Phylogenetic analysis is shown for bunyaviruses and parvoviruses. Finally, we identify Hundreds of novel protein sequences for CRISPR-associated proteins such as Transposase B, a class of small RNA-guided DNA editing enzymes.
