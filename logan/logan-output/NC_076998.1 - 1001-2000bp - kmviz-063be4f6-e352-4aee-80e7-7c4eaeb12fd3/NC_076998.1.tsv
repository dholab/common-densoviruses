With support from NIMH and NINDS as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), the Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA) applied single nucleus methylation sequencing in 118 brain funtional regions across the whole adult male P56 C57BL/6J mouse brain. In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons. These data define the landscape of cell type and spatial heterogeneity in the mouse brain and the underlining regulatory epigenomic basis.Overall design: Apply snmC-seq2 to 118 brain functional regions to identify epigenomic landcape of the adult mouse brain, this subseries consists of one single nucleus methylation sequencing experiment of brain region (AON)."

SRR584137	0.843	PRJNA176941	SAMN01760507	Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues from Arabidopsis are key regulators of alternative splicing with implications in fundamental developmental processes	"Alternative splicing (AS) generates transcript variants by the definition of different exonic and intronic regions and causes a massive expansion of transcriptome diversity. Changes in AS patterns have been found to be linked to manifold biological processes, yet fundamental aspects such as the regulation of AS and the functional implications of altered AS programs largely remain to be addressed. In this work, widespread AS regulation by Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues (AtPTBs) was revealed. In total 452 AS events derived from 308 distinct genes were found to be responsive to the levels of the splicing factors AtPTB1 and AtPTB2, which predominantly triggered splicing of regulated introns, inclusion of cassette exons, and usage of upstream 5' splice sites. In contrast, alternative 3' splice site events were strongly underrepresented among the AtPTB1/2 targets and no major AS regulatory function of the distantly related AtPTB3 was found. Dependent on their position within the mRNA, AtPTB-regulated events can both modify the untranslated regions and give rise to alternative protein products. Gene ontology analysis revealed a connection of AtPTB-mediated AS control with diverse biological processes, and the functional implications of selected AS events were further elucidated in the context of seed germination and flowering time control. Specifically, AtPTB misexpression changes AS of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 (PIF6) pre-mRNA, coinciding with altered rates of abscisic acid-dependent seed germination. Furthermore, AS patterns as well as the expression of key flowering regulators were massively changed in an AtPTB1/2 level-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work has revealed widespread AS regulatory functions of the AtPTB splicing factors with important functional implications in various fundamental processes of Arabidopsis development.Overall design: Analysis of alternative splicing patterns in plants with increased and decreased levels of the 3 Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein homologues in comparison to wild type samples, determined in duplicates"	PubMed:23192226	SRS367559	RNA-Seq	GEO	SRX193202	GSM1017178	Arabidopsis thaliana													325.0	401269.0	11199.0	44519118.0	36	7089655	2664	287489926	Illumina Genome Analyzer II	SINGLE	cDNA	TRANSCRIPTOMIC		ILLUMINA	SRP016026	2012-10-23	3282	101	5331			0

We and others previously showed that paternal administration of dexamethasone in mice affects the phenotype of their offspring. The substrate of intergenerational transmission of environmentally induced effects often involves changes in sperm RNA, yet other epigenetic modifications in the germline can be affected and are also plausible candidates. First, we tested the involvement of altered sperm RNAs in the transmission of dexamethasone induced phenotypes across generations. We did this by injecting sperm RNA into naïve fertilized oocytes, before performing metabolic and behavioral phenotyping of the offspring. We observed phenotypic changes in discordance with those found in offspring generated by in vitro fertilization using sperm from dexamethasone exposed males. Second, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on chromatin accessibility using ATAC sequencing and found significant changes at specific genomic features and gene regulatory loci. Employing q-RT-PCR, we show altered expression of a gene in the tissue of offspring affected by accessibility changes in sperm. Third, we establish a correlation between specific DNA modifications and stress hormone receptor activity as a likely contributing factor influencing sperm accessibility. Finally, we independently investigated this dependency by genetically reducing thymine-DNA glycosylase levels and observing concomitant changes at the level of chromatin accessibility and stress hormone receptor activity.Overall design: Tn5 fragmented mouse sperm chromatin of 3 Tdg+/- and 2 Ctrls as well as 3 Dexamethasone injected mice and 2 Vehicles were analyzed in regard to their chromatin accessibility"	PubMed:38065942	SRS17870320	ATAC-seq	EPIGENETICS AND NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY, INS, ETH ZURICH	SRX20565799	GSM7438685	Mus musculus													109.0	24544269.0	2995.0	1684411233.0	46	120664809	1056	5817219902	Illumina NovaSeq 6000	PAIRED	other	GENOMIC	GSM7438685	ILLUMINA	SRP440669	2023-12-09	11239	300	33382			0

Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health, but less is known how microbial control in health care or cleanroom facilities modifies the in-house microbiota and its associated resistome. To understand these human interventions, we compared the microbiota present in abiotic surfaces of clinical settings and other built environments. State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings. Our results highlight that the loss of microbial diversity correlates with an increase of resistances and indicate the need of implementing strategies to restore diversity to counteract propagation of resistances in the future.

SRR24234000	0.778	PRJNA957828	SAMN34271735	PfAP2-P DNA-binding protein is a master regulator of parasite pathogenesis during malaria parasite blood stages (ChIP-Seq II)	"Malarial parasite pathogenicity results from its ability to invade and remodel red blood cells (RBCs), expressing antigenic variant proteins for immune evasion and survival, and then to egress from the host cell.  These sequential processes require concerted actions of a large number of proteins during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), but the molecular basis of the required regulation is only partially understood. Here, we have characterized an essential Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) transcription factor (we refer to it as PfAP2-P; Master Regulator of Pathogenesis) that shows two peaks of expression during the IDC at 16- and 40-hour post invasion (h.p.i.). When expression of PfAP2-P at 40 h.p.i. was disrupted using an inducible gene knockout approach, ∆PfAP2-P parasites unable to form mature merozoites and egress from the host RBCs owing to strong down-regulation of several known egress- and invasion-associated genes, in addition to several novel hypothetical genes of thought to be involved in these key life cycle processes during the IDC. Disruption of PfAP2-P  expression at 16 h.p.i. results in transcriptional activation of virtually majority of silenced var genes observed at both bulk and single cell level. This is also reflected by significantly higher level of recognition of the exported proteins on the ∆PfAP2-P parasite-infected RBCs by pooled sera from malaria-exposed individuals from endemic region. In addition, over expression of many early gametocyte marker genes was also observed in ∆PfAP2-P parasites at both 40 h.p.i., and at 16 h.p.i. PfAP2-P directly regulates these genes by binding to their promoter region or indirectly through 14 other down-stream AP2 transcription factors. Taken together, we conclude that PfAP2-P is an upstream transcriptional regulator that participates in mutually exclusive expression pattern shown by the var family of genes and a critical determinant of parasite’s growth during the IDC.Overall design: Chip was performed on AP2-P parasites at 40 hour post invasion and 16 hour post invasion using rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9me3 (RRID:AB_310620), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9ac (RRID:AB_310544), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K4me3(RRID:AB_306649) antibodies .

The developmental principles directing the generation of SC cell-type diversity are however not understood. Here we pursued systematic cell lineage tracing in silico and in vivo, preserving full spatial information, using genetic MADM (Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers)-based clonal analysis with single-cell sequencing (MADM-CloneSeq). The analysis of clonally-related cell lineages revealed that radial glial progenitor (RGP) cells in SC are exceptionally multipotent. Individual resident RGPs have the capacity to produce all excitatory and inhibitory SC neuron types, even at the stage of terminal division. While individual clonal units show no pre-defined cellular composition, the establishment of appropriate relative proportions of distinct neuronal types occurs in a PTEN-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings provide an inaugural framework at single RGP/cell level of the mammalian SC ontogenyOverall design: scRNA-Seq of neurons originating from a single radial glia progenitor (clone) labeled at E10 using MADM and Fz10-CreER or Sox2-CreER"		SRS19137032	RNA-Seq	HIPPENMEYER, INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AUSTRIA (IST AUSTRIA)	SRX22066941	GSM7836515	Mus musculus													259.0	62979.0	2073.0	5794669.0	38	472299	1562	21706845	NextSeq 550	PAIRED	cDNA	TRANSCRIPTOMIC SINGLE CELL	GSM7836515	ILLUMINA	SRP465826	2023-11-03	74	74	189			0

The host response in the NP regulates an intricate balance between viral control and tissue pathology. The hyper-inflammatory responses promote epithelial injury, allowing for increased viral dissemination and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. However, the pathologic contributors to influenza upper respiratory tissue pathology are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17RA as a modulator of influenza host response and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. We used a combined experimental approach involving IL-17RA-/- mice and an air-liquid interface (ALI) epithelial culture model to investigate the role of IL-17 response in epithelial inflammation, barrier function, and tissue pathology. Our data show that IL-17RA-/- mice exhibited significantly reduced neutrophilia, epithelial injury, and viral load. The reduced NP inflammation and epithelial injury in IL-17RA-/- mice correlated with increased resistance against co-infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn).

We tracked human astroviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses and adenoviruses over time to the level of strains or even individual nucleotide variations, showing how detailed human pathogens can be observed using wastewater. For respiratory pathogens, a broad enrichment panel enabled us to detect waves of RSV, influenza, or common cold coronaviruses in high agreement with clinical data. By applying a profile Hidden Markov Model-based search for novel viruses, we identified more than 100 thousand novel transcript assemblies likely not belonging to known virus species, thus substantially expanding our knowledge of virus diversity. Phylogenetic analysis is shown for bunyaviruses and parvoviruses.

We have an incomplete understanding of how cytokines elicit their functional pleiotropy, which has limited their therapeutic use. Here, using Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we have performed detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human Th-1 cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We have identified CDK8 as a new negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities that contributes to the diversification of IL-6 responses.  We found that CDK8 is a major regulator of the IL-6 phosphoproteome, and interacts with STAT3 in the nucleus upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecules inhibitors, reduced the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. This, in turn, resulted in retention of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus, which increased the binding of STAT3 to target DNA sites in the genome with a concomitant increase in STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions resulted in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity via modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to tuning STAT3 mediated responses.Overall design: Role of CDK8 in IL-6-induced STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity in human T cells."

Concurrent with the transition of the pluripotency states is the specification of cell lineages and formation of germ layers in the embryos that serves as the blueprint for embryogenesis. Fate mapping and lineage analysis studies have revealed that cells in different regions of the germ layers acquire location-specific cell fates during gastrulation. The regionalization of cell fates heralding the formation of the basic body plan is conserved in vertebrate embryos at a common phylotypic stage of development. Knowledge of the molecular regulation that underpin the lineage specification and tissue patterning is instrumental for understanding embryonic programming and stem cell-based translational study. However, a genome-wide molecular annotation of lineage segregation and tissue architecture of post-implantation embryo has yet to be undertaken. Here, we reported a spatially resolved transcriptome of cell populations at defined positions in the germ layers over the period of pre- to late gastrulation development. This spatio-temporal transcriptome provides high resolution digitized gene expression profiles and defines the molecular attribute of the genealogy of lineages and continuum of pluripotency states in time and space. The transcriptome further identifies the networks of molecular determinants that drive lineage specification and tissue patterning in the early postimplantation mouse embryo.Overall design: By using spatial transcriptome of Geo-seq, we carried out transcriptome profiling on embryo sections at a high resolution of 20-40 cells per sample. We then constructed a comprehensive spatial transcriptome map from the pre-gastrulation to late-gastrulation embryos that are visualized in a 3D embryonic model based on the sequencing data.

In each major brain regions, we identified distinct cell clusters and formed them in a hierarchical taxonomy. These clusters include known primary brain cell types and possible sub-types. We use these data to identify the epigenomic characteristics and to define specific regulatory elements for each cell cluster. We integrate the single cell methylome with single cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles from the same brain region to further identify potential enhancers and their corresponding genes for several neuronal cell types. By brain region spacial comparisons, we found spatial specificity among excitatory neuronal clusters within the same cortical layer. We identify brain-region-specific transcription factors that may regulate cortical region development of excitatory neurons.

How these processes are spatiotemporally regulated remains unclear. Here we show that nuclear RNA-binding protein Rbm14 and maternal mRNAs co-phase separate into cytoplasmic condensates to facilitate vertebrate blastula-to-gastrula development. In zebrafish, Rbm14 condensates were highly abundant in blastomeres and markedly reduced after prominent activation of zygotic transcription. They concentrated at spindle poles by associating with centrosomal -tubulin puncta and displayed mainly asymmetric divisions with a global symmetry across embryonic midline in 8-cell and 16-cell embryos. Their formation was dose-dependently stimulated by m6A, but repressed by m5C modification of the maternal mRNA. Furthermore, deadenylase Parn co-phase separated with these condensates, and this was required for deadenylation of the mRNAs in early blastomeres. Depletion of Rbm14 impaired embryonic cell differentiations and full activations of the zygotic genome in both zebrafish and mouse and resulted in developmental arrest at the blastula stage. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic Rbm14 condensate formation regulates early embryogenesis by facilitating deadenylation, protection, and mitotic allocation of m6A-modified maternal mRNAs, and by releasing the poly(A)-less transcripts upon regulated disassembly to allow their re-polyadenylation and translation or clearance.Overall design: Zebrafish embryo mRNA profiles of ctrl-MO and 14-tMOs by deep sequencing at 2.5hpf, 4hpf and 6hpf.

The host response in the NP regulates an intricate balance between viral control and tissue pathology. The hyper-inflammatory responses promote epithelial injury, allowing for increased viral dissemination and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. However, the pathologic contributors to influenza upper respiratory tissue pathology are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17RA as a modulator of influenza host response and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. We used a combined experimental approach involving IL-17RA-/- mice and an air-liquid interface (ALI) epithelial culture model to investigate the role of IL-17 response in epithelial inflammation, barrier function, and tissue pathology. Our data show that IL-17RA-/- mice exhibited significantly reduced neutrophilia, epithelial injury, and viral load. The reduced NP inflammation and epithelial injury in IL-17RA-/- mice correlated with increased resistance against co-infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). IL-17A treatment, while potentiating the apoptosis of IAV-infected epithelial cells, caused bystander cell death and disrupted the barrier function in ALI epithelial model, supporting the in vivo findings.Overall design: 13 samples"		SRS16951020	RNA-Seq	UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA	SRX19567610	GSM7081467	Mus musculus													99.0	6639794.0	2883.0	403816346.0	35	49277421	806	2040563565	Illumina HiSeq 4000	PAIRED	cDNA	TRANSCRIPTOMIC	GSM7081467	ILLUMINA	SRP425795	2023-10-31	4496	302	12090			0

This RNA sequencing experiment is part of the study 'Preclinical animal model of Diamond-Blackfan anemia with single amino acid mutation of ribosomal protein Rps19'. A mouse model with arginine 67 mutation of ribosomal protein Rps19 develops features characteristic of human Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a rare bone marrow failure syndrome. These include hematologic dysfunctions, early onset growth delay, intrinsic anemia, severe craniofacial, skeletal, urogenital, cardiovascular, and cerebral abnormalities leading to premature lethality during the adolescence of the mouse. This model exhibits cell intrinsic activation of the Trp53 signaling pathway in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leading to reduced erythroid lineage development that may be rescued after inactivation of the tumor suppressor Trp53. Using preliminary RNA sequencing study we identify a set of non-canonical components of the p53 signaling pathway which with high likelihood mediate the wide range of pathologies associated with DBA, the experiment if followed up by single cell transcriptome analysis of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors and RNA sequencing of E14.5 fetal liver from wild-type control and Rps19R67∆/R67∆, Rps19R67∆/R67∆ Trp53−/− and Trp53−/− mutant embryos.

However, whether these marks can be passed on from gametes to the next generation in mammals is a long-standing question that remains unclear. By developing a highly sensitive approach, STAR ChIP-seq, we provided a panoramic view of the landscape of H3K4me3, a histone hallmark for transcription initiation 2, from developing gametes to postimplantation embryos. Interestingly, we found that upon fertilization, extensive reprogramming occurred on the paternal genome, as few H3K4me3 peaks were observed in zygotes before they reappeared after major zygotic genome activation at the late 2-cell stage. On the maternal genome, we unexpectedly found a non-canonical form of H3K4me3 (ncH3K4me3) in full-grown and mature oocytes, which exists as broad peaks at promoters and a large number of distal loci. Such broad H3K4me3 peaks are in striking contrast to typical sharp H3K4me3 peaks restricted in CpG rich regions of promoters. Interestingly, ncH3K4me3 in oocytes overlaps almost exclusively with partially methylated DNA domains (PMDs). It is then inherited in preimplantation embryos before being erased in the late 2-cell embryos, when canonical H3K4me3 starts to be established. The removal of ncH3K4me3 requires zygotic transcription but is independent of DNA replication mediated passive dilution. Finally, downregulation of H3K4me3 in full-grown oocytes by overexpressing an H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5B is associated with defects in genome silencing. Taken together, these data unveiled inheritance and highly dynamic reprogramming of the epigenome in early mammalian development.Overall design: Mouse preimplantation embryos were obtained from crosses of C57BL/6N and PWK. A newly developed ChIP-seq approach (STAR ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq were performed in these embryos at variou stages in preimplantation development.Please note that [1] 'PN5 zygote histone H3' sample represents input files for PN5_K4me3 sample, using H3 antibody.[2] both separate (for each replicate sample, i.e. sample supplementary file) and combined processed bed file (for all replicates, i.e. Series supplementary file) have been provided."
