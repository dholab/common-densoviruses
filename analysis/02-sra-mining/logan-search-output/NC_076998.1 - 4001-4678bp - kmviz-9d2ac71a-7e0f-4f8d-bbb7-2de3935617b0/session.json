State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings.

Changes in AS patterns have been found to be linked to manifold biological processes, yet fundamental aspects such as the regulation of AS and the functional implications of altered AS programs largely remain to be addressed. In this work, widespread AS regulation by Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues (AtPTBs) was revealed. In total 452 AS events derived from 308 distinct genes were found to be responsive to the levels of the splicing factors AtPTB1 and AtPTB2, which predominantly triggered splicing of regulated introns, inclusion of cassette exons, and usage of upstream 5' splice sites. In contrast, alternative 3' splice site events were strongly underrepresented among the AtPTB1/2 targets and no major AS regulatory function of the distantly related AtPTB3 was found. Dependent on their position within the mRNA, AtPTB-regulated events can both modify the untranslated regions and give rise to alternative protein products. Gene ontology analysis revealed a connection of AtPTB-mediated AS control with diverse biological processes, and the functional implications of selected AS events were further elucidated in the context of seed germination and flowering time control. Specifically, AtPTB misexpression changes AS of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 (PIF6) pre-mRNA, coinciding with altered rates of abscisic acid-dependent seed germination. Furthermore, AS patterns as well as the expression of key flowering regulators were massively changed in an AtPTB1/2 level-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work has revealed widespread AS regulatory functions of the AtPTB splicing factors with important functional implications in various fundamental processes of Arabidopsis development.\rOverall design: Analysis of alternative splicing patterns in plants with increased and decreased levels of the 3 Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine-tract binding protein homologues in comparison to wild type samples, determined in duplicates","36":"Aquarium water virome","37":"In this study, we used whole genome resequencing to study the genomic diversity of African yam (Dioscorea sp.) in order to get insight into the domestication process.","38":"Deep sequencing environmental air samples.","39":"Laboratory mice comprise an inexpensive and expeditious model organism for preclinical vaccine testing; however, vaccine immunogenicity often fails to adequately translate to humans. Recent reports indicate that reconstituting physiologic microbial experience to specific pathogen free (SPF) mice induces durable immunological changes that better recapitulate the human immune system. We examined the impact of microbial experience on responses to vaccination after cohousing laboratory mice with pet store mice. We demonstrate that human transcriptional responses to influenza vaccination are better recapitulated in cohoused mice. Induction of humoral responses by vaccination was dampened in cohoused mice and resulted in poor control upon challenge. Additionally, the establishment of protective heterosubtypic T cell immunity was compromised in cohoused mice. In summary, SPF mice exaggerated both humoral and T cell protection induced by influenza vaccines compared to cohoused mice, suggesting that reconstituting microbial experience in laboratory mice through cohousing may better inform preclinical vaccine testing.\rOverall design: SAMPLE GROUP 1: Pet store mice were purchased from various Twin Cities area pet stores. Pet store mice were cohoused with 8-week-old female C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory). Cohousing occurred within a BSL-3 facility. C57BL/6 mice were cohoused for 60 days, bled for flow cytometry analysis and screened for infectious agents using EZ-spot and PCR Rodent Infections Agent (PRIA) array methods (Charles River Laboratories). Age-matched mice were maintained in SPF facilities.\rSAMPLE GROUP 2: For IAV infections, mice were anesthetized using a weight-based dose of ketamine/xylazine delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Mice were vaccinated intranasally (i.n.) with 1000 PFU of X31 or vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 180 ug of 2019-2020 seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur) with or without 25 uL AddaVax (InvivoGen). For challenge, mice were infected i.n. with 1000 PFU of PR8.\rWhole lungs were harvested and RNA was extracted using AllPrep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen). The cDNA library was prepared using strand-specific RNA-sequencing protocols. Samples were run on an Illumina NovaSeq (50 bp paired-end). We obtained an average of 27 million read pairs per sample. Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using Bowtie aligner (bowtie2 version 2.3.4.1) with local mode, -L 22 and -N 1 parameters (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Reads were assigned to Ensembl gene models (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.87.gtf) with featureCounts of the Subread software package (version 1.5.1) (Liao et al., 2014). The reads count matrices were organized corresponding to experimental design and used for subsequent statistical analysis using the bioconductor package edgeR (version 3.24.3) (McCarthy et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2010). The raw reads count table were normalized by using default method in the package prior to generating statistics. Multidimensional scaling was performed with edgeR using the top 500 differentially expressed genes across samples. The regression model in the edgeR package with block design and interaction model was used for statistical analysis to select the corresponding significant genes. Gene ontology analysis was performed using Panther on genes in each cluster with an adjusted p value <0.01 and LogFC >0.5.\rMouse PBMCs were isolated using Ficol-Paque PREMIUM (Millipore Sigma) and RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Plus Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA library was prepared using strand-specific RNA-sequencing protocols. Samples were run on an Illumina NovaSeq (150 bp paired-end). We obtained an average of 35 million read pairs per sample. Sequence processing and mapping was performed as described above. The normalized reads table of mouse blood samples were reformatted to meet the requirements for the subsequent GSEA analysis (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005). The gene lists were prepared from human vaccination data and merged into an immune geneset (c7.immune.datasets.gmt) to generate a customized geneset (c7.custom.immune.datasets.gmt) (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2005). The mouse datasets originated from either SPF or dirty mouse models were computed against the customized geneset by using desktop GSEA analysis engine with default parameters except the enrichment plot generation.","4":"The biological samples correspond to viral concentrates obtained from sewage samples from Lausanne Vidy WWTP.","40":"The upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx or NP) is the first site of influenza replication, allowing the virus to disseminate to the lower respiratory tract or promoting community transmission. The host response in the NP regulates an intricate balance between viral control and tissue pathology. The hyper-inflammatory responses promote epithelial injury, allowing for increased viral dissemination and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. However, the pathologic contributors to influenza upper respiratory tissue pathology are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17RA as a modulator of influenza host response and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. We used a combined experimental approach involving IL-17RA-/- mice and an air-liquid interface (ALI) epithelial culture model to investigate the role of IL-17 response in epithelial inflammation, barrier function, and tissue pathology. Our data show that IL-17RA-/- mice exhibited significantly reduced neutrophilia, epithelial injury, and viral load. The reduced NP inflammation and epithelial injury in IL-17RA-/- mice correlated with increased resistance against co-infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). IL-17A treatment, while potentiating the apoptosis of IAV-infected epithelial cells, caused bystander cell death and disrupted the barrier function in ALI epithelial model, supporting the in vivo findings.\rOverall design: 13 samples","41":"Viral-like particle enriched viromics of apis mellifera.","42":"The three-dimensional folding of genomes in the eukaryotic nucleus can influence the expression of genes.

We have an incomplete understanding of how cytokines elicit their functional pleiotropy, which has limited their therapeutic use. Here, using Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we have performed detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human Th-1 cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We have identified CDK8 as a new negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities that contributes to the diversification of IL-6 responses.  We found that CDK8 is a major regulator of the IL-6 phosphoproteome, and interacts with STAT3 in the nucleus upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecules inhibitors, reduced the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation. This, in turn, resulted in retention of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus, which increased the binding of STAT3 to target DNA sites in the genome with a concomitant increase in STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions resulted in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity via modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to tuning STAT3 mediated responses.\rOverall design: Role of CDK8 in IL-6-induced STAT3 mediated transcriptional activity in human T cells.","46":"Using single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, we profiled mouse embryonic stem cells and neural precursor cells to identify lincRNAs with cell type- and subpopulation-specific expression. In contrast to mRNAs, we found that lincRNAs are prone to prematurely terminate transcription, are less abundant across single cells, and are degraded by the nuclear exosome. These properties indicate that lincRNA genes widely function without requiring their RNA product. To test this prediction experimentally, we developed a method that separates the role of a lincRNA gene from the role of its RNA product. This revealed RNA-independent lincRNA gene activities, underscoring the importance of distinguishing the roles of transcription, the genomic locus, and the RNA product when studying non-coding loci, for which we are providing suitable tools.\rOverall design: Two mESC lines (BL6xCAST and CASTxBL6) were differentiated into neural precursor cells, as well as being sampled in 2i+LIF and in serum+LIF medium. Bulk RNA-seq was performed for all timepoints (2i+LIF, serum+LIF, day3, day6 and day8 of differentiation). Most timepoints were also sampled by single-cell RNA-seq (96 cells per sample, 7 samples in total). Cell lines with lincRNA genomic deletions, or with the hammerhead ribozyme genomically integrated into lincRNA loci, were also analysed by bulk RNA-seq (140 cell lines in total). We also performed CRosslinking and Analysis of CDNAs (CRAC) in wild-type cells or cells where endogenous Mtr4 is tagged with a FLAG-Bio tag, to examine transcriptome-wide targets of the nuclear RNA surveillance factor Mtr4. For normalisation, we performed NET-seq.

These sequential processes require concerted actions of a large number of proteins during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), but the molecular basis of the required regulation is only partially understood. Here, we have characterized an essential Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) transcription factor (we refer to it as PfAP2-P; Master Regulator of Pathogenesis) that shows two peaks of expression during the IDC at 16- and 40-hour post invasion (h.p.i.). When expression of PfAP2-P at 40 h.p.i. was disrupted using an inducible gene knockout approach, ∆PfAP2-P parasites unable to form mature merozoites and egress from the host RBCs owing to strong down-regulation of several known egress- and invasion-associated genes, in addition to several novel hypothetical genes of thought to be involved in these key life cycle processes during the IDC. Disruption of PfAP2-P  expression at 16 h.p.i. results in transcriptional activation of virtually majority of silenced var genes observed at both bulk and single cell level. This is also reflected by significantly higher level of recognition of the exported proteins on the ∆PfAP2-P parasite-infected RBCs by pooled sera from malaria-exposed individuals from endemic region. In addition, over expression of many early gametocyte marker genes was also observed in ∆PfAP2-P parasites at both 40 h.p.i., and at 16 h.p.i. PfAP2-P directly regulates these genes by binding to their promoter region or indirectly through 14 other down-stream AP2 transcription factors. Taken together, we conclude that PfAP2-P is an upstream transcriptional regulator that participates in mutually exclusive expression pattern shown by the var family of genes and a critical determinant of parasite’s growth during the IDC.\rOverall design: Chip was performed on AP2-P parasites at 40 hour post invasion and 16 hour post invasion using rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9me3 (RRID:AB_310620), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K9ac (RRID:AB_310544), rabbit polyclonal anti H3K4me3(RRID:AB_306649) antibodies . There are two biological replicates for each developmental stages. The input  served as the control.","49":"Nucleic acids in wastewater provide a rich source of data for detection and surveillance of microbes. We have longitudinally collected 116 RNA samples from a wastewater treatment plant in Berlin/Germany, from March 2021 to July 2022, and 24 DNA samples from May to July 2022. We tracked human astroviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses and adenoviruses over time to the level of strains or even individual nucleotide variations, showing how detailed human pathogens can be observed using wastewater. For respiratory pathogens, a broad enrichment panel enabled us to detect waves of RSV, influenza, or common cold coronaviruses in high agreement with clinical data. By applying a profile Hidden Markov Model-based search for novel viruses, we identified more than 100 thousand novel transcript assemblies likely not belonging to known virus species, thus substantially expanding our knowledge of virus diversity. Phylogenetic analysis is shown for bunyaviruses and parvoviruses. Finally, we identify Hundreds of novel protein sequences for CRISPR-associated proteins such as Transposase B, a class of small RNA-guided DNA editing enzymes. Taken together, we present a longitudinal and deep investigation into wastewater-derived genomic sequencing data that underlines the value of sewage surveillance for public health, planetary virome research, and biotechnological potential.\rOverall design: Raw influx from Berlin/Germany wastewater treatment plants was collected over a time period from May 2021 to July 2022, total RNA and (from May 2022 to July 2022) total DNA extracted and subjected to high-throughput sequencing.","5":"Deep sequencing environmental air samples.","6":"We aimed to characterize gut virome at the onset of islet autoimmunity utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.","7":"We identified that the coordinated expression of exogenous Runx1 and Hoxa9 during the haematopoietic induction process from mouse PSC resulted in a type of induced hemogenic endothelial cells (iHEC). The single iHEC can be robustly educated into induced haematopoietic progenitor cells (iHPC), which gave rise to induced T cells (iT cells) with abundant TCRαβ repertoire in vivo. We  sorted  the  single iHEC and iHPC  from  day-14,  day-17,  day-21  cell  products  derived  from  241 iR9-ES  and  performed  single-cell  RNA-Seq.\rOverall design: mRNA profiles of 73 single hematopoietic endothelia cells (iHEC). single HCs were sorted from PSC-derived cells for RNAseq analysis according to kit instruction of Discover-sc WTA Kit V2(Vazyme) and TruePrepTM  DNA Library Prep Kit V2 (Vazyme), using illumina NextSeq500.","8":"We report the application of genome architecture mapping in specific cell types in mouse brain. We generated cell-type specific chromatin contact maps in mouse dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA DN), pyramidal glutamatergic neurons from the cornus ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus (CA1 PGN), and non-neuronal post-mitotic oligodendrocytes from the somatosensory cortex (SSC_Olig). We explored cell-type specific chromatin topologies genome-wide at multiple genomic scales. Our data demonstrates that chromatin organization is cell type specific and reflects cell specialization at all genomic scales.\rOverall design: Briefly, we isolated single thin tissue sections by ultrathin cryosectioning (approx. 220 nm) of the mouse brain region of interest, and selected specific cell-types using immunofluorescence with specific AB markers. Following cell identification, 3 nuclear sections (nuclear profiles; NPs) were captured by laser microdissection in individual PCR caps. We then extracted, amplified and sequenced the DNA from each PCR cap.","9":"Water-born virome"},"bioproject_title":{"0":"Double-strand break map for the top6bl mouse","1":"DNA Methylome and 3D
