# Common densoviruses in the human and mammalian virospheres

Densoviruses (subfamily Densovirinae, family Parvoviridae) are small, non-enveloped T=1 icosahedral ssDNA viruses whose linear genomes are typically ~4 to 6 kb and terminate in hairpin structures that act as replication origins (Cotmore et al., 2019; Bergoin and Tijssen, 2000). Genome organization follows the parvoviral pattern with a 5′ nonstructural block encoding NS proteins including the SF3 helicase/endonuclease NS1, and a 3′ capsid block encoding VP proteins, with extensive use of alternative promoters, leaky scanning, and splicing to generate multiple products (Bergoin and Tijssen, 2000; Guérin et al., 2015). At the genus level, densoviruses show meaningful architectural variation: Iteradensoviruses have a monosense transcription strategy and multiple VP size variants (ICTV Iteradensovirus Report, 2023), whereas Ambidensoviruses use an ambisense arrangement with oppositely oriented NS and VP cassettes (Liu et al., 2015). Replication occurs in the nucleus and requires host S-phase functions, producing prominent intranuclear inclusions (Ren et al., 2017). Consistent with that dependence, cellular tropism is skewed toward mitotically active or differentiating tissues in natural hosts, commonly larval, gut, epidermal, or hematopoietic compartments, and infections can be acutely lytic or persistent depending on host and virus lineage (Bergoin and Tijssen, 2000; Ren et al., 2017). ICTV taxonomy recognizes multiple densovirus genera distributed across two deep evolutionary branches within Densovirinae, underscoring their long-standing diversification in invertebrates (ICTV Densovirinae Report, 2023; ICTV Parvoviridae Report, 2023).￼

Evidence for densovirus infection of mammals remains limited, and most detections in mammalian samples are interpreted as environmental or dietary transit from infected invertebrates rather than productive replication. For instance, densovirus sequences recovered from insectivorous bat feces cluster with arthropod densoviruses, consistent with ingestion and passage through the gut (Li et al., 2012). A frequently cited human-linked genome is human CSF-associated densovirus 1 (HuCSFDV1), detected and independently confirmed in cerebrospinal fluid from a patient with anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis; the genome is highly divergent but falls within iteradensovirus-like lineages (Phan et al., 2016). Additional human associations include metagenomic detection of densovirus-like sequences in plasma from Cameroonian blood donors participating in blood-borne virus surveillance, again without evidence of a sustained clinical syndrome or demonstrated human tropism (Sadeuh-Mba et al., 2023). Densoviruses have also been noted as low-abundance members of the cutaneous DNA virome in longitudinal shotgun metagenomic surveys of healthy skin, including the Oh et al. skin microbiome study, where densovirus reads were cataloged but not a focus of analysis (Oh et al., 2016). Together, these reports suggest that densovirus sequences can be recovered from human-associated samples, but whether they represent rare vertebrate infection, transient carriage, or contamination remains unresolved, and there is still no robust experimental system showing efficient densovirus replication in vertebrate cells in vitro or in vivo (Phan et al., 2016; Cotmore et al., 2019).  ￼

The interpretation of such sporadic detections is changing rapidly because sequence-based interrogation of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) has become practical at petabase scale. Early efforts such as Serratus used cloud-based ultra-high-throughput alignment of SRA runs to reference sets, effectively bringing targeted, BLAST-like screening to millions of datasets but still requiring substantial compute and being optimized for family-level discovery rather than arbitrary ad hoc queries (Edgar et al., 2021; Serratus Project, 2020). More recent indexing approaches build searchable k-mer or graph representations of SRA content. Logan-search allows users to submit a short query sequence and receive ranked SRA accessions likely to contain matching reads within minutes (LoganSearch GitHub, 2025; Logan Consortium, 2024). MetaGraph similarly indexes public read sets into compressed de Bruijn graph structures enabling rapid presence/absence and abundance queries over petabases of data, with follow-up alignment providing nucleotide-level confirmation (Karasikov et al., 2024; Karasikov et al., 2025). Practically, these frameworks extend BLAST-like functionality to SRA turning what was previously computationally expensive or prohibitive per query into web searches that can be completed in minutes (Karasikov et al., 2024; Logan Consortium, 2024).

Our group has been developing air sampling as a metagenomic surveillance platform for human viruses. Using Thermo Fisher AerosolSense samplers deployed in built environments, we showed that sequence-independent workflows coupled to deep sequencing can recover diverse respiratory and enteric viruses directly from ambient air, including influenza A/C, RSV, seasonal coronaviruses, rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, rotavirus, and astroviruses, validating air metagenomics as a practical complement to clinical and wastewater surveillance (Minor et al., 2023). In parallel, air monitoring has been extended to ports of entry: active samplers placed near customs and immigration areas of major U.S. international airports generated nucleic acids that were processed by hybrid-capture enrichment using Illumina RNA Prep with Enrichment and the Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, enabling metagenomic recovery of dozens of viral taxa and high-quality genomes for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, bocavirus, and seasonal coronaviruses from airport air samples (Air Monitoring in International Airports Consortium, 2025). Together, these studies establish that low-biomass air samples can be rendered sequence-informative by combining high-volume aerosol capture with unbiased or capture-enriched metagenomics, and that the approach scales from local congregate settings to globally connected travel hubs (Minor et al., 2023; Air Monitoring in International Airports Consortium, 2025).  ￼

During our continued analysis of air metagenomic datasets generated in these efforts, we repeatedly observed densovirus contigs closely related to the previously described HuCSFDV1, appearing across multiple independent air samples and settings. This unexpected recurrence in air samples provided a rationale to revisit the question of densoviruses in mammals using orthogonal data streams. Specifically, it motivated three linked follow-ups: first, systematic mining of public SRA datasets for reads related to HuCSFDV1-like sequences using petabase-scale search tools; second, re-analysis of the longitudinal skin metagenomes in Oh et al. to quantify and contextualize densovirus signal in the cutaneous virome; and third, targeted screening of additional air samples collected through our ongoing surveillance network to map prevalence, diversity, and geographic distribution of densovirus reads in air.

## Results

### HuCSFDV1 is commonly found in air samples from congregate spaces

We collected air samples from congregate indoor spaces in K-12 schools, essentially as previously described. In most sites, a (now discontinued) [ThermoFisher AerosolSense](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/aerosolsense-airborne-pathogen-detection-solution/2900AA) is run continuously for at least one day. One school in our program also uses an [InBio Apollo](https://inbio.com/apollo/) for air sample collection. Particulates are eluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween. Total nucleic acids are extracted from the eluate on a [Promega Maxwell](https://www.promega.com/products/lab-automation/automated-dna-rna-extraction-purification-maxwell/) instrument. Nucleic acids are enriched for viruses using the Illumina VSP2 protocol [according to the manufacturer's recommendation](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/viral-surveillance-panel.html0). The purpose of target enrichment is for monitoring of conventional human pathogens. Densoviruses are not included in the VSP probes and are therefore not specifically enriched. Sequences were obtained on an [Illumina NovaSeq X Plus](https://biotech.wisc.edu/dna-seq/illumina/) operated by the [UW-Madison Biotechnology Center](https://biotech.wisc.edu/dna-seq/illumina/). Three datasets with [102 total samples](air-samples/vsp/vsp-sample-metadata.md) were sequenced in three independent VSP2 experiments.

We developed a [Snakemake workflow](data_processing/read_mapping) that aligns reads to the HuCSFDV1 reference [NC_076998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_076998.1) using [minimap2 (v2.28-r1209)](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) with short-read presets, and the resulting alignments are processed through [samtools (v1.20)](https://www.htslib.org) for coordinate sorting, mate-pair fixing, and PCR duplicate removal, yielding indexed BAM files suitable for variant calling and coverage analysis.

Figure 1 shows that 76 of the 102 samples from K-12 schools had at least one read mapped to HuCSFDV1. While spurious read mapping could be explained by non-specific mapping, 14 of the samples had at least 100 reads mapped to HuCSFDV1. The sample with the strongest read support for HuCSFDV1, termed `high-school-001-20250901-pooled`, was collected between 2025-09-04 and 2025-09-08. 2,355 reads from this sample mapped to HuCSFDV1. The majority consensus sequence from this sample is 99% nucleotide identical to HuCSFDV1, with 48 majority consensus nucleotide substitutions.

> **Figure 1.** Air samples frequently have reads mapping to HuCSFDV1. An interactive IGV browser with these results is available [here](https://dholab.github.io/common-densoviruses/dane_county_air/). 

Fortuitously, two sites (high-school-001 and elementary-school-004) each yielded more than 100 mapped reads in independent early, mid, and late September 2025 air samples. For each September collection, we generated consensus sequences from indexed BAM files with `samtools consensus` (v1.20) using FASTA output and retaining ambiguous sites as N to avoid biasing downstream distance calculations, and [aligned these sequences](air-samples/vsp/align/consensus_plus_ref.aln.fasta) together with the NC_076998 reference using [MAFFT (v7.526)](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) with default nucleotide parameters. Phylogenies were inferred with [IQ-TREE (v3.0.1)](https://iqtree.github.io) under a GTR+G model with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates, rooting on [NC_076998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_076998.1) to provide an external outgroup. Figure 2 shows that the three elementary-school-004 consensuses formed a monophyletic cluster distinct from the three high-school-001 consensuses, which similarly grouped together, consistent with independent circulation of related but distinct viruses in the two schools rather than repeated sampling of a shared source.

We recently participated in another air sampling project in [international airports](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.22.25336185v3). Metagenomic sequencing with VSP enrichment was also performed on a subset of these samples (Bioproject: PRJNA989177), resulting in 159 datasets. Reads from these datasets were downloaded and mapped to the HuCSFDV1 reference as described above. Seven samples had a [single paired-end read](air-samples/tgs/consensus) that mapped to HuCSFDV1; a BLASTN search against core-nt (as of 23 November 2025) unambiguously HuCSFDV1 as the most significant alignment for all seven. Unlike schools where air samplers are located primarily in cafeterias where students and staff dwell, the air samplers in airports were located in international arrival corridors. Arriving passengers would be in the vicinity of the air samplers briefly, possibly accounting for the less robust detection of HuCSFDV1 reads. Nevertheless, this demonstrates that reads corresponding to this virus were found in multiple air samples in two international airports, Dulles and San Fransisco, separated by thousands of miles.

### HuCSFDV1 is detected in NCBI SRA mammalian datasets

The HuCSFDV1 reference [NC_076998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_076998.1) was split into 1kb segments. Each segment was input into [Logan Search](https://logan-search.org/dashboard) using the default treshold of 0.5 and the 'All' reference group. [The results](logan/logan-output) of Logan Search for each segment were combined to create the set of matching SRA accessions. [This table](logan/sra-metadata.md) shows all of the matching datasets. To expore HuCSFDV1-like reads in these SRA datasets, the reads were downloaded with fasterq-dump, mapped to the HuCSFDV1 reference and deduplicated as described above, yielding indexed BAM files that are visualized in Figure 3. Two human SRA datasets (SAMN05172265 and SAMN05172266) were deposited in 2016 in support of the original manuscript describing HuCSFDV1. Both were identified in this analaysis, providing a sanity check on the use of Logan Search to find additional datasets containing HuCSFDV1-like reads.

![Figure 3](docs/logan/igvjs.svg)

> **Figure 3.** SRA datasets with reads mapping to HuCSFDV1. An interactive IGV browser with these results is available [here](https://dholab.github.io/common-densoviruses/logan/). 

Clues to HuCSFDV1 infection in humans comes from the three human datasets also have matches to HuCSFDV1 that were independent from the two datasets associated with the discovery of HuCSFDV1. One was found in a [German investigation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6819125/) of the CSF from a 28 year old with subclinical neuroinflammation. The only 28 year old described in the mauscript has the identifier code BF-H. In addition to adding an independent confirmation that HuCSFDV1 can be detected in human CSF, this dataset used single cell RNAseq allowing us to triangulate the type of cells containing HuCSFDV1 reads. Unlike most of the Logan Search results which had reads mapping throughout the HuCSFDV1 genome, SRR8478958 was characterized by reads mapping entirely to NS3, consistent with NS3 expression in whatever target cell(s) are infected. Indices for the single cells sequenced in this experiment are available in [GEO GSE127969](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127969). The data from this BioSample ([SAMN10713895](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN10713895)) is split between two runs, [SRR8478958](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR8478958) and [SRR8466401](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR8466401). No reads mapping to HuCSFDV1 were detected in SRR8466401, which contains sequences from the CD4+ fraction of the CSF from this participant. SRR8478958 contains non-CD4+ CSF lymphocytes. The indices needed to deconvolute SRR8478958 into single cells is unfortunately not avaialble, so at the moment we can only surmise that HuCSFDV1 transcripts are likely in non-CD4+ CSF lymphocytes. The second human dataset, from BioSample [SAMN14427291](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN14427291) and described in [Martinez-Fabregas et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7773550/). Thanks to the assistance of Majid Kazemian and Suman Mitra who submitted the samples to SRA and provided additional information, we learned that the primary cells were collected from a healthy donor. PBMC were purified from buffy coats and polarized towards a Th1 phenotype before bulk RNA sequencing. This again supports lymphocytes as the potential target for HuCSFDV1. The third dataset is from BioSample [SAMN02199191](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN02199191), which was submitted as part of a [French study examining the functions of RNA polymerase III](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3875860/). These reads were derived from [human IMR90 cells](https://www.atcc.org/products/ccl-186), fibroblasts derived from a 16 week old female. Unlike the other two human studies, this study also included murine samples, raising the possibility that these hits could have been due to cross-contamination from mice. It is also possible, however, that viral detection in fibroblasts indicates that HuCSFDV1 can infect skin cells, possibly accounting for the frequent detection of HuCSFDV1 in air metagenomes that include nucleic acids sloughed from skin.

Murine datasets reveal a striking pattern distinct from human samples. Unlike the human datasets where viral reads correlate with lymphocytes and CSF cells, the majority of mouse samples with HuCSFDV1-related sequences derive from **germ cells and brain tissue**, with no lymphocyte samples represented. The sample with the highest mapped read count (19,470 reads) comes from BioSample [SAMN35556869](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN35556869), a sperm sample from an [ETH Zurich study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA978525) examining epigenetic inheritance through ATAC-seq of mouse sperm chromatin. The second-largest cluster of samples originates from [PRJNA272507](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA272507), representing the original development of Genome Architecture Mapping (GAM) in mouse embryonic stem cells, [described by Beagrie et al. in Nature](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5366070/). These samples, labeled with "NP" (nuclear profile) designations, underwent thin cryosectioning of nuclei followed by DNA sequencing—a protocol that would capture any viral DNA present in the nucleus. Additional brain-derived samples come from [PRJNA625732](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA625732), a [2021 Nature study by Winick-Ng et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04081-2) that applied immunoGAM to specific brain cell types including pyramidal glutamatergic neurons (PGNs), dopaminergic neurons (DNs), and oligodendrocytes (OLGs). The Salk Institute's [CEMBA project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8494641/) contributed numerous brain samples using single-nucleus methylation sequencing. Multiple meiotic cell samples from [PRJEB43730](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB43730) used DMC1-SSDS ChIP to map double-strand breaks during meiosis, and [single sperm sequencing from Oxford](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30898898/) (PRJNA515881) examined meiotic recombination. Notably, none of the mouse studies with the most abundant HuCSFDV1 reads involve scRNAseq that could be used to identify which specific cell types contain viral transcripts. The predominance of germ cell and neural samples—rather than lymphocytes—in mouse datasets may reflect either different tissue tropism of a related murine virus, or alternatively, that these sample types are particularly amenable to detecting these viral reads. The absence of mouse CSF or lymphocyte datasets in the Logan Search results makes direct comparison with the human tissue tropism difficult to establish.

### Integrated analyses of NS1 of air, SRA, and known densovirus samples

To determine the relationship of the various samples with HuCSFDV1-like sequences and the known universe of Densovirinae in NCBI Genbank, we extracted and translated NS1 sequences because NS1 is the most conserved protein across densoviruses, carries the rolling-circle endonuclease and SF3 helicase motifs, and aligns far more reliably than full genomes that contain long non-coding hairpins, rapidly evolving VP regions, and frequent frameshifts in fragmented metagenomic contigs. An amino acid–level comparison reduces nucleotide saturation and codon-usage noise, making it easier to distinguish genuinely divergent clades from alignment artifacts. We rooted the tree using four Parvovirinae NS1 sequences (human B19 erythroparvovirus, adenovirus-dependent AAV-like dependoparvovirus, feline protoparvovirus, and human bocaparvovirus) to provide a vertebrate outgroup that is clearly outside Densovirinae, allowing us to polarize splits and test whether HuCSFDV1-like sequences cluster with known insect densoviruses versus forming a distinct vertebrate-associated branch. NS1 amino acid FASTA files from VSP air samples, Logan SRA hits, and the GenBank densovirus reference set were concatenated, low-information records containing only ambiguous characters were removed, and sequences were aligned with MAFFT (v7.526, `--auto`, 12 threads). A maximum-likelihood tree was inferred with IQ-TREE (v3.0.1) under LG+G4+F with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap and 1,000 SH-aLRT replicates, rooting on the Parvovirinae outgroup to constrain the direction of evolution (Figure 4). All of the sequences from the air samples and SRA form a separate node from all other densovirinae NS1 amino acid sequences.

## Discussion

This study would not have been possible without the advent of new search tools like Logan Search that enable exploration of datasets in NCBI SRA. In an era where biomedical research resources are being scrutiznized for cost-effectiveness, the foresight to store deep sequencing datasets en masse despite not having computational tools to query all of SRA at once is a testament to the leadership of NIH and the scientific community's willingness to share results from their studies. Perhaps the most important new data in support of a role for HuCSFDV1 in people comes from a study of multiple sclerosis in monozygotic twins, where the HuCSFDV1 reads initially went unnoticed. Success stories like this should galvinize scientists to continue depositing sequencing datasets and associated metadata in SRA despite the time and effort required. One limitation of relying on SRA queries, however, is that dataset biases propagate. Without exquisite knowledge of each dataset, it is possible that reagent conatminants or other artifacts could poison analyses such as this one.

However, we do not believe that this accounts for these results. If the source of HuCSFDV1 is a reagent contaminant we would expect to see datasets with matching kmers throughout SRA, largely irrespective of sample origin, due to commonalities in nucleic acid extraction and sequencing library preparation. 

Alternatively, is the detection of HuCSFDV1 in human and mouse datasets simply a function of these datasets being vastly more common than insect datasets in SRA? In other words, one potential explanation for the apparent mouse and human predominance is that datasets from the known densovirus hosts are not as common in SRA. The number of SRA datasets associated with each taxonomic rank (and rank subtrees) of known densovirus hosts as of 26 November 2025 are: 
- Blattodea (cockroaches & termites) - 6179
- Diptera (flies) - 374,969
- Hemiptera (true bugs) - 32,059
- Hymenoptera - 103,337
- Lepidoptera (moths & butterflies) - 93,852
- Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets & katydids) - 10,253
- Crustacea - 78,320
- Echinodermata - 20,870

In total, there are 719,839 SRA datasets from these taxa, yet they are virtually unrepresented in the SRA datasets with HuCSFDV1-like reads. Therefore, it is unlikely that HuCSFDV1 is commonly found in the invertebrate hosts that are infected by other densoviruses.

There is an additional densovirus enigma that we have been unable to resolve. In a 2016 manuscript from Oh et al, metagenomic sequencing was performed 594 skin samples from 12 healthy individuals. A subset of these individuals had reads that were categorized as Acheta domestica (i.e., house cricket) densovirus. Sequencing reads from the manuscript are available in [NCBI BioProject 46333](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=46333). The datasets from this paper are described in its [Supplemental Table 1](https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.chom.2025.07.002/attachment/453ad112-12d9-4947-99e3-95d46ad9a736/mmc2.xlsx). [Supplemental Table 2](https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.008/attachment/db43522c-ed59-47f2-a378-469abee3924b/mmc3.xlsx) shows that densovirus reads were found in samples:
- HV03 (MET0083)
- HV04 (MET0508)
- HV05 (MET0785)
- HV08 (MET0202, MET0203, MET0204, MET0205, MET0206, MET0207, MET0208, MET0209, MET0210, MET0211, MET0212, MET0213, MET0214, MET0215, MET0216, MET0217, MET0392, MET0703, MET0704, MET0705, MET0706, MET0707, MET0708, MET0709, MET0710, MET0711, MET0712, MET0713, MET0714, MET0715, MET0716, MET0719, MET0723, MET0724, MET0725, MET0726, MET0727, MET0728, MET0729, MET0730, MET0731, MET0732, MET0733, MET0734, MET0735, MET0736, MET0738)
- HV09 (MET0223)
- HV11 (MET0293, MET0299, MET0601)

Clearly, there is something very distinctive about HV08 where densovirus reads were found in multiple skin sampling sites and at multiple timepoints. Our initial hypothesis upon seeing this data is that these reads were also HuCSFDV1-like but were misclassified as Acheta domestica because HuCSFDV1 had not yet entered the taxonomic classification databases. However, when 

Additionally, [Supplemental Table S2 from Oh et al.](https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.008/attachment/db43522c-ed59-47f2-a378-469abee3924b/mmc3.xlsx) describes 585 samples with taxonomic classifications, including 56 samples with densovirus reads. We reformatted this into [a table](oh-et-al-skin-microbiome/samples-with-densovirus-status.md) that describes the 585 samples, the corresponding data in NCBI, and densovirus status.

Taken together, these results provide provocative preliminary evidence that HuCSFDV1 and closely related densoviruses are found in the human and mammalian virospheres much more commonly than previously appreciated. Detection of viral nucleic acids in human lymphocytes and CSF from a second dataset independent from its initial characterization suggests that this is not simply an environmental remnant. Moreover, the common observation of HuCSFDV1 viral nucleic acids in air samples from congregate spaces occupied by people sugggests that the prevalence of this virus may be considerable. Phan and colleagues (Phan et al., 2016) discovered HuCSFDV1 in a child with encephalitis and it is notable that the second CSF sample containing HuCSFDV1 was also associated [with neuroinflammation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6819125/), albeit subclinically. It would be premature to suggest a causal relationship between neuroinflammation or other human pathologies with HuCSFDV1 infection, however, the previously unrecognized prevalence of this virus in human spaces and samples suggests that studies evaluating such relationships should be undertaken. The common detection of HuCSFDV1-like nucleic acids in mice provides a direct pathway to better understand these viruses and their hosts. It should be straightforward to use reverse genetics, as previously described for other parvoviruses, to rescue HuCSFDV1 viruses for in vivo infections. These viruses can also be used to better understand the cellular tropism and replication of these viruses in vitro.
